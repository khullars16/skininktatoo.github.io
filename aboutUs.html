            <h2>Our Approach</h2>

            <p>For us its just not work, we take pride in the artwork we deliver. We encourage each other to achieve
                excellence and aren’t satisfied until we meet our personal high.</p>


            <h2>Our attitude</h2>
            <p>We are a team of professionals and always try to do productive things and not just try to make quick
                buck.
                We very well know how to trace your ideas on your skin and make you feel great about your tattoo.</p>


            <h2>Our unique skills</h2>
            <p>Over the years we have continuously added stars to our work. This was only possible to achieve because of
                our extraordinary skills. Aliens specialize in realistic tattoos which is not everyone’s cup of tea.
                Besides
                that we ace in color tattoo, geometric , dot work and abstract tattoos.</p>


            <h2>Our experience</h2>
            <p>To date we have successfully satisfied thousands of clients who wished for the best and got it. We have
                been
                running this business for over 11 years and today it is at its zenith.</p>


            <h2>Our quality</h2>
            <p>We use this word quite often but here we mean it. Quality is our motto. From the high quality needles,
                inks
                to the high class equipment used at Aliens, everything is up to date. . And we continually evolve and
                adapt
                the best equipment in the industry.</p>


            <h2>Our Hygiene</h2>
            <p>Our workplace is often praised by our clients for its cleanliness and for the

                hygiene standards that we follow. Everything involved in the process while tattooing is either
                disposable or
                sterilized. This eliminates the risk of human errors and enables us to maintain high sanitation
                standards.</p>


            <h2>After Care</h2>


            <ul>
                <li> Once you’ve gotten a permanent tattoo, the hardest part is over, but your work isn’t done. Pay
                    careful
                    attention to help the healing process and protect the newly acquired tattoo’s color and shape. It’s
                    just as
                    important to take good care of the tattooed area as it is to treat any other skin wound.
                </li>

                <li> Keep the bandage on the tattoo for at least 5-10 mins after the work is complete (possibly longer,
                    depending
                    on the tattoo artist’s instructions).
                </li>

                <li>Remove the bandage very carefully and leave it off. This allows your skin to breathe and begin the
                    healing
                    process.
                </li>

                <li> Wash tattoo with your hand (make sure hand is clean) using warm, soapy water. Rinse with cold
                    water. Don’t
                    over soak your tattoo. Keep out of the direct spray of the shower. Pat dry, DO NOT rub with towel.
                </li>

                <li> Use mild soap (Dettol/Savlon) to lightly rinse the tattoo. Lightly pat it dry with a washcloth,
                    taking care
                    not to rub it.
                </li>

                <li>Lightly apply Johnson-n-Johnson baby oil/Aloe Vera gel to your tattooed skin for complete healing
                    period
                    (About Two Months). Expose your healing skin to air as much as possible without soaking in the sun.
                </li>

                <li>Tattoo will flake. DO NOT pick at the flakes or you may pull the color out. Try not to let clothing
                    rub on
                    your tattoo while it is healing.
                </li>

                <li>Avoid getting a lot of water on your new tattoo – showers are OK, but no swimming for a few weeks.
                </li>
            </ul>
